# Sidebar

---

### Where the files are located?

The files for customization are located in the `.readrave` folder.

Say if you documentation lies in `/docs`, then you have to create a file name `docs.sidebar.yaml` in the `.readrave` folder.

### How to customize the sidebar?

The sidebar is a YAML file that is used to generate the sidebar for the particular documentation.

Say this is your sidebar file:

```yaml
- title: Getting Started
- title: Introduction
  href: /docs
- title: Installation
  href: /docs/installation
```

Run the following command to generate the sidebar, or whenever you make changes to the sidebar configuration file:

```bash
bunx readrave@latest sync
```

This will generate the following sidebar for the documentation:

<div className="not-prose flex flex-col space-y-2.5 py-12 text-sm text-foreground/50">
  <p className="select-none font-semibold text-primary">Getting Started</p>
  <Link
    className="font-foreground/50 hover:text-primary hover:underline"
    href={'/docs'}
  >
    Introduction
  </Link>
  <Link
    className="font-foreground/50 hover:text-primary hover:underline"
    href={'/docs/installation'}
  >
    Installation
  </Link>
</div>

As you can see, the sidebar is generated based on the configuration provided in the sidebar file.

- When no `href` is provided, the title is used as a heading and is semibold by default.

You can additionally add the following properties to the sidebar configuration:

```yaml
- title: Introduction
  href: /docs
  css:
    fontWeight: 400
    # ... Add any other CSS property here
```

Run `bunx readrave@latest sync` to generate the sidebar with the updated configuration.
