### TypeScript

This project and the components are written in TypeScript. We recommend using TypeScript for your project as well.

- We will add support for JavaScript in the future.
- More granular control over the installation process will be added in the future.

### Installation

To bootstrap a project with Readrave, you can use the following command:

```bash
bunx readrave@latest init
```

The command only overwrites these files:

```md
- next.config.mjs
- tailwind.config.ts
- app/globals.css

* mdx-components.tsx
* lib/utils.ts
```

The command will add the following files:

```md
# .readrave folder:

- docs.sidebar.yaml => sidebar configuration

# components/readrave folder:

- navbar.tsx => navbar for website (disabled by default)
- sidebar.tsx => sidebar for doc based pages
- backnext.tsx => previous / next in article
- breadcrumb.tsx => breadcrumb in article
- sheet.tsx => shadcn/ui sheet support
- scroll-area.tsx => shadcn/ui scroll area support

# app/(readrave)/docs folder:

- layout.tsx
- page.mdx
- sidebar.ts
- installation/page.mdx
```
